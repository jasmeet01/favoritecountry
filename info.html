    <cite>author :UC BERKLEY</cite>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: green;" > <b> there  in’s no denying that Italy is a country of immense natural beauty – from the Dolomite mountains to the volcanic islands off Sicily’s coast, the resplendent lakes of the north to the idyllic Tuscan countryside, and an endless stretch of sparkling coastline in between. But it’s also true that some of the most beautiful places in Italy are its cities.

    From Eternal Rome and other timeworn metropolises to the country’s smaller student cities, there’s endless urban beauty in Italy’s open piazzas, ornate fountains, decadent churches, bustling markets, outdoor cafes, and winding alleyways strung with laundry lines. Bastions of history, safe-keepers of art, culture and cuisine, every Italian city is rich with delights waiting to be explored.
    
    If you’re a city slicker like me, you’ll never run ou Italy. Don you best walking shoes and get ready for some serious cobblestones – this list brings together 25 of the most beautiful Italian cities for your wish list, as chosen by me and other travel writers.
